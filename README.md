# Eco Footprint Calculator

## Overview
The Eco Footprint Calculator is a Java-based application that enables users to calculate their ecological footprint based on their weekly miles driven and energy consumption. This application aims to raise awareness about individual contributions to carbon emissions and promote sustainable living practices.

## Features
- **Miles Driven Input**: Users can input the number of miles they drive on a weekly basis.
- **Energy Consumption Input**: Users can input their energy consumption in kWh per week.
- **Unit Selection**: Supports various units for distance (miles, kilometers) and energy consumption (kWh, MWh).
- **CO2 Emissions Calculation**: Upon providing the necessary inputs, users can calculate their estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

## How It Works
The application uses average values for CO2 emissions per mile and per kWh to estimate the total carbon footprint. Users input their weekly miles driven and energy consumed, and the application calculates the total CO2 emissions based on these inputs.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

## Running the Application
1. Compile the Java file `EcoFootprintCalculatorGUI.java`.
2. Run the compiled Java class using the command `java EcoFootprintCalculatorGUI`.
